# KH2AIDebug
Enables debugging syscalls in KH2 AI scripts.

This is a DLL-based mod that only works with the Panacea mod loader. Additionally, you must open `panacea_settings.txt` in the `KH_1.5_2.5` folder and add the line `show_console=true` for the mod to work. If you have LuaBackend installed, the console will start hidden, press `F2` to show it.
